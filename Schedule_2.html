<h1>Schedule 2</h1>
<h2>What are Schedule 2 drugs?</h2>
<p>Schedule 2 drugs are drugs that once again are completely banned however the main difference is that very few doctors can prescribe Schedule 2 drugs. Drugs under schedule 2 can be complicated when being prescribed, as the conditions for getting a prescribtion for a substance under schedule 2 not only need to be very specific but also need to be received from a very specific doctor. Your doctor will most likely be able to prescribe schedule 2 drugs but they do need the right licenses</p>
<ul>List of some drugs under schedule 2</ul>
<li>Cocaine</li>
<li>Methamphetamine</li>
<li>Fentanyl</li>
<li>Opium</li>
<p>Schedule 2 drugs are just like schedule 1 drugs and are also very bad for the human body as getting addicted to any schedule 2 substance can end up ruining your life <strong>permanently.</strong> The only reason why doctors are allowed to prescribe schedule 2 substances is because they can be beneficial to the human body under very few circumstances.</p>
