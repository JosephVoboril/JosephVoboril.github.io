<h1>Schedule 3</h1>
<h2>What are Schedule 3 drugs?</h2>
<p>Schedule 3 drugs are drugs that have a decently high potential for abuse and are under a watch list</p>
<ul>List of drugs under shcedule 3</ul>
<li>Anabolic Steriods</li>
<li>Ketamine</li>
<li>Modafinil</li>
<li>Butylone</li>
<h2>Why are there drugs bad?</h2>
<p>Schedule 3 drugs are still kind of easy to get addicted to, however, the main big difference between schedule 3 and schedule 1-2 is the fact that schedule 3 drugs don't harm the body as much as schedule 1-2 drugs. A good example of this are anabolic steriods which is basically artificial testosterone in a syringe that is injecting in your body to give you more testostorone. This isn't too bad and could benefit your body heavily if you have the right conditions, however, it is still dangerous to OD on this drug.</p>
