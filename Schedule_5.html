<h1>Schedule 5</h1>
<h2>What are schedule 5 drugs?</h2>
<p>Schedule 5 drugs have even lower potential drug abuse than schedule 4, and are commonly used in many medicines that several doctors handout daily</p>
<ul>List of drugs under schedule 5</ul>
<li>Lasmiditan</li>
<li>Pregabalin</li>
<li>Ezogabine</li>
<li>Ganaxolone</li>
<h2>Why are there drugs bad?</h2>
<p>Truth is, schedule 5 drugs are not that bad, and have very little potential for abuse. Most schedule 5 drugs you would have never heard of, simply because schedule 5 drugs don't make a name for themselves. Stuff like Methamphetamine, Anabolic steriods, etc, are popular due to the fact that they have high potential for abuse, and have crazy affects. Schedule 5 drugs mostly don't do this, so they're not popular but still commonly used in medicines by doctors.</p>
