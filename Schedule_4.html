<h1>Schedule 4</h1>
<h2>What are schedule 4 drugs?</h2>
<p>Schedule 4 drugs are drugs that have a low abuse potential but can still be abused</p>
<ul>List of drugs under schedule 4</ul>
<li>Valium</li>
<li>Mesterolone</li>
<li>Ambien</li>
<li>Alprazolam</li>
<h2>Why are there drugs bad?</h2>
<p>Schedule 4 drugs are pretty safe and used almost commonly in most medicines. Believe it or not, but a doctor has probably injected you with one of these drugs listed above. Schedule 4 drugs are still on a watchlist however and can be abused but not nearly as much as schedule 1-3. Getting your hands on these drugs would infact be easier than schedule 1-3, however you would still need to speak with a doctor in order to be prescribed schedule 4 drugs <strong>most</strong> likely.</p>
